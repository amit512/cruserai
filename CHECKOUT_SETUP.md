- `cart_items` - Shopping cart items
- `orders` - Order records

## How the Checkout System Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User adds products to cart (`cart.php` â†’ `actions/cart_action.php`)
2. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" button
3. User is redirected to checkout page (`checkout.php`)
4. User fills out shipping and payment information
5. User submits checkout form (`actions/checkout_action.php`)
6. System creates orders and clears cart
7. User is redirected to success page (`order-success.php`)

### 2. Order Processing
- **Checkout Action** (`actions/checkout_action.php`):
  - Validates form data
  - Creates individual orders for each cart item
  - Saves shipping details to `order_details` table
  - Updates product stock quantities
  - Clears user's shopping cart
  - Uses database transactions for data integrity

### 3. Cart Management
- **Cart Action** (`actions/cart_action.php`):
  - Handles adding/removing items
  - Updates quantities with stock validation
  - Manages cart operations securely

### 4. Security Features
